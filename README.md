3D ToolKit for cocos2dx
==========
by yang chao (wantnon), 2014-1-9  

3D ToolKit for cocos2dx is a simple 3D extension for cocos2d-x, provide an easy way to create 3D graph in cocos2dx environment.  
  
the ToolKit based on cocos2d-x 2.2.0.
   
features currently available:  
1, vector and matrix operations.  
2, extended 3D camera. (support perspective and orthographic projection mode)  
3, 3D Sprite. (support space transformation, change mesh, and shader)   
4, extended shader program and uniform callback.  
   
note: because 3DToolKit is based on cocos2dx 2.x and written in pure c++, so it is cross platform. but here i only configured the iOS project. so if you want too run it on other platform, you should configure the corresponding project by yourself.      
注意：因为3DToolKit建立在cocos2dx 2.x基础上，且使用纯c++编写，所以它是跨平台的。但是我这里只配了iOS工程，所以如果想在其它平台上运行，需要自己配置相应的工程。
